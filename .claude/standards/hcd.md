# Human-Centered Design Standards

> Guidelines for designing with users at the center of every decision.

## Core Principles

1. **Empathy First** - Understand users deeply before designing
2. **Inclusive Design** - Design for the full range of human diversity
3. **Iterative Validation** - Test with real users early and often
4. **Context Matters** - Consider the environment where the product is used
5. **Simplicity Over Features** - Solve core problems exceptionally well

## The HCD Process

### 1. Discover (Empathize)
**Goal:** Understand users, their needs, and their context

**Methods:**
- User interviews (1:1)
- Contextual inquiry (observe in real environment)
- Surveys and questionnaires
- Analytics review
- Stakeholder interviews

**Deliverables:**
- User research findings
- Pain points and opportunities
- Current journey maps

### 2. Define
**Goal:** Synthesize research into actionable insights

**Methods:**
- Affinity mapping
- Persona development
- Problem statement definition
- Jobs-to-be-done framework

**Deliverables:**
- User personas
- Problem statements
- Prioritized user needs

### 3. Ideate
**Goal:** Generate solutions to defined problems

**Methods:**
- Brainstorming sessions
- Design studios
- Competitive analysis
- "How Might We" questions

**Deliverables:**
- Solution concepts
- Prioritized ideas
- Initial sketches/wireframes

### 4. Prototype
**Goal:** Make ideas tangible for testing

**Methods:**
- Paper prototypes
- Digital wireframes
- Interactive prototypes
- Wizard of Oz testing

**Deliverables:**
- Testable prototypes
- Prototype documentation

### 5. Test
**Goal:** Validate solutions with real users

**Methods:**
- Usability testing
- A/B testing
- Preference testing
- Task analysis

**Deliverables:**
- Test findings
- Iteration recommendations
- Validated designs

## User Personas

### Template
```
Name: [Representative name]
Role: [User type/role]
Demographics: [Relevant characteristics]

Goals:
- [Primary goal]
- [Secondary goals]

Pain Points:
- [Current frustrations]
- [Unmet needs]

Behaviors:
- [Relevant behaviors]
- [Technology comfort level]

Quote: "[Something they might say]"
```

### For This Project (To Be Defined)
<!-- Add personas as they are developed -->
- [ ] Primary persona
- [ ] Secondary persona(s)
- [ ] Edge case users

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.1 Compliance (Target: AA)

**Perceivable:**
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Provide captions for video/audio
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for text)
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information

**Operable:**
- All functionality available via keyboard
- No content that flashes more than 3 times/second
- Provide skip navigation links
- Clear focus indicators

**Understandable:**
- Consistent navigation
- Predictable behavior
- Error identification and suggestions
- Labels and instructions for inputs

**Robust:**
- Valid HTML
- Name, role, value for custom components
- Compatible with assistive technologies

## Inclusive Design Considerations

### Physical Diversity
- Motor impairments (keyboard navigation, large touch targets)
- Visual impairments (screen readers, high contrast)
- Hearing impairments (captions, visual alerts)
- Cognitive differences (clear language, simple layouts)

### Situational Limitations
- Bright sunlight (high contrast)
- Noisy environments (visual indicators)
- One-handed use (thumb-friendly zones)
- Slow connections (progressive loading)

### Cultural Considerations
- Language and localization
- Date/time formats
- Cultural color meanings
- Reading direction (LTR/RTL)

## Validation Checkpoints

### Before Development
- [ ] User research conducted
- [ ] Personas defined
- [ ] Problem statements validated
- [ ] Designs tested with users

### During Development
- [ ] Accessibility audit
- [ ] Usability heuristic review
- [ ] Content review for clarity

### After Launch
- [ ] User feedback collection
- [ ] Analytics monitoring
- [ ] Satisfaction surveys
- [ ] Iteration planning
